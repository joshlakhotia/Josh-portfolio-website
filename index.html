          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Josh, an American full stack developer and air sports enthusiast living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm always looking for the next big challenge or learning opportunity, whether that be in coding, skydiving, BASE jumping, or speedflying!</p>
          <p>My web development skills are currently at the level of basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript and transitioning to the use of frameworks such as React. I have a basic understanding of Git and Github and will soon be learning backend development with node/express.js and PostgreSQL databases. </p>
          <p>While my main focus at this point is web development, I am constantly exploring other technologies. Blockchain, especially solidity and rust, are next on my list of topics to pursue.</p>

          <h2>About This Site</h2>
          <p>Not only is this page my portfolio, it is my place to experiment and level up my skills. With every new skill learned and practiced, it will be implemented here in some way. As of right now it is just a static webpage, but hopefully in the future it will become a breathing work of internet art.</p>
          <p>My current projects that I deem worthy of presenting are listed below which I'm sure will demonstrate my capabilities.</p>
          <p>At the very bottom of the page will be a section I'm using to practice with the display of media using photos/videos of myself and friends doing what we do best in the sky.</p>
